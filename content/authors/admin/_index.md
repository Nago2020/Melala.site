I am passionate about using statistics and data science to address real-world challenges. 
My primary interest lies in developing and applying novel statistical methods to get reliable insights from complex data and support meaningful decision-making. 
Currently, I am working on indirect treatment comparisons and treatment switching analysis in the context of clinical trials, in collaboration with MSD (Merck) Pharmaceutical Company. 

 <!-- I am a research associate at KU Leuven, Belgium. 
 
 
 in the Methods for Big Data group (https://kleinlab-statml.github.io/) at KIT, Germany. 
 Before moving to KIT, I completed my PhD in Statistics at KU Leuven, where I also completed two years of postdoctoral training. 

In addition, I had the privilege of collaborating with pharmaceutical companies and various industries during my time as a statistical consultant at the Data Science Institute (DSI), Hasselt University.
I thrive on leveraging data to drive informed decisions and create impactful solutions.



#I am passionate about statistics and data science, enjoying the challenge of transforming data into actionable insights. 

As a former statistical consultant at the Data Science Institute (DSI), Hasselt University, Belgium, I had the privilege of collaborating with pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and various industries. My role at DSI involved designing and executing comprehensive studies, calculating sample sizes for diverse study designs, 
proposing innovative statistical methods, conducting detailed data analyses, 
writing R programs and statistical reports. I thrive on leveraging data to drive informed decisions and create impactful solutions.
