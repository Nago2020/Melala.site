I am interested in statistics and data science, and I enjoy playing with data to generate data-driven decisions. 

I am a statistical consultant at the Data Science Institute (DSI), Hasselt University, Belgium. At DSI, I have worked with pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and industries to design and execute studies, calculate sample sizes for different study designs, propose new statistical methods, conduct data analysis, and write R programs and statistical reports. 

<!--I have gained the following experience during my tenure at DSI:  Clinical study protocol writing, Sample size calculations for  superiority, non-inferiority and equivalence trials, Adaptive clinical trials, and statistical methods for drug discovery. -->

Before moving to Uhasselt, I completed my PhD in Statistics at KU Leuven, Belgium, where I also completed approximately two years of postdoctoral training under the supervision of Professor Ingrid Van Keilegom. My MSc in Statistics (specialization in Biostatistics) was from Hasselt University.
