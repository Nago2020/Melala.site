 I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Methods for Big Data group (https://kleinlab-statml.github.io/) at KIT, Germany. 
 Before moving to KIT, I completed my PhD in Statistics at KU Leuven, where I also completed two years of postdoctoral training. 

I had also the privilege of collaborating with pharmaceutical companies and various industries when I was a statistical consultant at the Data Science Institute (DSI), Hasselt University.
I thrive on leveraging data to drive informed decisions and create impactful solutions.
