abstract: "When pricing life annuity or insurance products issued to multiple lives,
  actuaries require a model for the survival of coupled lifetimes. For reasons of
  simplicity these multiple life premiums are often calculated under the assumption
  of independent lifetimes. In some circumstances this assumption is not realistic,
  and a number of correction methods based on bivariate survival data have been proposed
  in the actuarial literature. However, when we only observe the first occurring event
  time, the applicability of the models suggested for bivariate survival data turns
  out to be limited. The aim of this paper is to propose a copula-based analysis for
  bivariate survival data subject to left truncation and dependent censoring when
  only the first event time is observed. Our method is based on parametric marginals
  and parametric copulas. For this model, we show that the association between the
  survival and dependent censoring time is identifiable from the distribution of the
  observed data. The proposed model is estimated using maximum likelihood, which simultaneously
  estimates the marginal and dependency parameters. We also develop a goodness-of-fit
  test approach to examine the validity of the fitted copula model. Finally, our approach
  is illustrated on data from a large Canadian life insurance company. We hereby price
  joint and last-survivor annuities from data subject to left-truncation, administrative
  as well as dependent censoring."
