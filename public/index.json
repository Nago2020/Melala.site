The SemiPar.depCens package is built to provide easy-to-use functions in R for estimation of the dependent censoring methodology proposed in Deresa and Van Keilegom (2024). The approach presented in the latter paper is based on a parametric copula for the relation between the survival time and the censoring time, and the parameter defining the copula does not need to be known. Instead, the copula parameter is estimated jointly with other finite model parameters by following a pseudo-likelihood approach. The main idea is to decompose the estimation in two steps instead of a direct optimization. First, obtain a consistent estimator of the cumulative hazard function using a martingale-based estimating equation. Then, substitute it into the likelihood function to obtain the pseudo maximum likelihood estimator for finite-dimensional parameters. This allows us to overcome a very complex estimation of the Cox model due to the presence of dependent censoring.\nAvailable copula functions in SemiPar.depCens package includes Frank, Gumbel and Normal copulas. Only Weibull and Lognormal models are allowed for the censoring model, even though any parametric model that satisfies certain identifiability conditions could be used.\nInstallation The SemiPar.depCens package is available here on the CRAN and can be installed for free. To install it in R, use:\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;SemiPar.depCens\u0026#34;) Example This is a basic example which shows how to use the package in practice.\nlibrary(SemiPar.depCens) data(\u0026#34;follic\u0026#34;) # load the data # Prepare the data in the way that is used by the package follic = follic[order(follic$time),] # order the observed survival time Z = round(follic$time,digits = 3) d1 = as.numeric(follic$status==1) # censoring indicator for survival time T d2 = as.numeric(follic$status==2) # censoring indicator for dependent censoring C treat = as.numeric(follic$ch==\u0026#34;Y\u0026#34;) # treatment indicator age = (follic$age-mean(follic$age))/sd(follic$age) # recommended to standardize continuous variables hgb = (follic$hgb-mean(follic$hgb))/sd(follic$hgb) # standardized hemoglobin clinstg = as.numeric(follic$clinstg==1) # clinical stage X = cbind(treat,age,hgb,clinstg) # data matrix for T, should be in matrix form W = cbind(rep(1,length(Z)),treat,age,hgb,clinstg) # data matrix for C, should be in matrix form resData = data.frame(\u0026#34;Z\u0026#34; = Z,\u0026#34;d1\u0026#34; = d1, \u0026#34;d2\u0026#34; = d2) # resData should be a data frame Fit dependent censoring model The following code fit a default copula, which is Frank, for the relation between the survival time (T) and dependent censoring time (C).

This post will focus on dependent censoring and its consequences on standard survival models. It is known that the standard models, e.g., the Kaplan Meier estimator for survival function and the Cox proportional hazards model, assume that the survival time (T) is independent of the censoring time (C). This is a crucial assumption for producing valid inferences. Unfortunately, there is no formal test for the independent censoring assumption since we never observe survival time and censoring time simultaneously. Given the difficulty of checking this assumption, the data analysts have often analyzed survival data without warning that their results are valid under the independence assumption. So, this post aims to create awareness among statisticians by showing what will happen when the standard models do not satisfy the independence assumption.\nBefore moving on to what happens when independent censoring is not satisfied, let me discuss under what scenarios this assumption makes sense. The independence assumption is commonly assumed to obtain identifiability and to allow model estimation without experiencing many difficulties. For instance, the independence assumption makes sense for the administrative censoring mechanism in which the censoring happens at the end of the study. In general, if the mechanism that induces censoring is entirely unrelated to the event of interest, we can do our data analysis under this assumption. However, there are many practical applications where the independent censoring assumption is unrealistic. For example, in medical studies, patients may withdraw from the study because their condition is deteriorating or because they show side effects that need alternative treatments. Here, the reason for withdrawal may be linked to the expected event of interest, which induces dependent censoring.\nWhat happens when independence is assumed but T and C are in reality dependent ? As I mentioned, the standard models work under the assumption that T is independent of C (given covariates). Let me investigate the effect of deviating from this assumption by giving a numerical example. For example, let $$ T = -\\text{log}(u)/\\lambda, \\quad C = -\\text{log}(v)/\\lambda, $$ $$ \\mbox{where } \\lambda = 0.2 \\mbox{ and } (u,v) \\mbox{ is generated from a Gumbel copula with} $$ $$ \\mbox{ parameter } \\alpha = 1, 5, \\mbox {corresponding to Kendall’s } \\tau \\mbox{ of 0 and 0.8. } $$ Due to right censoring, we observe $$ Z = \\mbox{min} (T,C) \\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad \\Delta = I(T \\le C). $$ For an arbitrary sample size of n = 300, I calculate the true survival function and the Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator of the true survival function, which assumes T is independent of C. The data-generating model and simulation steps are summarized in the R chunk below.\nlibrary(copula) library(survival) set.seed(12346) n = 300 lambda = 0.2 gumb.cop = gumbelCopula(param = 5, dim =2) # Gumbel copula U = rCopula(n,gumb.cop) T1 = -log(U[,1])/lambda C = -log(U[,2])/lambda Z = pmin(T1,C) delta = as.numeric(T1 \u0026lt;= C) After data generation, the true survival function is estimated using the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method. The figure below presents the Kaplan-Meier estimator for survival function superimposed on the true survival function for two levels of association.\nIt can be observed that when 𝝉 = 0 (so there is no dependent censoring), the KM method provides an excellent estimate of the true survival function, as expected. For positive association, 𝝉 = 0.8, we observe that the KM approach overestimates the true survival. The reason is that a positive association between the survival and censoring time indicates that censored individuals will likely have their event soon after their censoring time, whereas under the KM method it is assumed that for a censored observation the (unobserved) survival time can be any value larger than the censoring time, not necessarily a value close to the censoring time.\nI hope from this post it is clear that the independence assumption is the most crucial assumption for making correct or unbiased inference based on the standard models.\nIn next posts, I will cover what can be done when there is a dependent censoring problem.

For reasons of simplicity these multiple life premiums are often calculated under the assumption of independent lifetimes. In some circumstances this assumption is not realistic, and a number of correction methods based on bivariate survival data have been proposed in the actuarial literature. However, when we only observe the first occurring event time, the applicability of the models suggested for bivariate survival data turns out to be limited. The aim of this paper is to propose a copula-based analysis for bivariate survival data subject to left truncation and dependent censoring when only the first event time is observed. Our method is based on parametric marginals and parametric copulas. For this model, we show that the association between the survival and dependent censoring time is identifiable from the distribution of the observed data. The proposed model is estimated using maximum likelihood, which simultaneously estimates the marginal and dependency parameters. We also develop a goodness-of-fit test approach to examine the validity of the fitted copula model. Finally, our approach is illustrated on data from a large Canadian life insurance company. We hereby price joint and last-survivor annuities from data subject to left-truncation, administrative as well as dependent censoring.","tags":"Source Themes","title":"A multivariate normal regression model for survival data subject to different types of dependent censoring","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Negera Wakgari Deresa","Ingrid Van Keilegom"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1636156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636156800,"objectID":"96623f8fb2d63d1b2bc518fb285623ec","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/publication/journal-article1/index1/","publishdate":"2021-11-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article1/index1/","section":"publication","summary":"When modelling survival data, it is common to assume that the survival time is conditionally independent of the censoring time ($T,C$) given a set of covariates. However, there are numerous situations in which this assumption is not realistic. The goal of this paper is therefore to develop a semiparametric normal transformation model which assumes that, after a proper nonparametric monotone transformation, the vector follows a linear model, and the vector of errors in this bivariate linear model follows a standard bivariate normal distribution with a possibly nondiagonal covariance matrix. We show that this semiparametric model is identifiable, and propose estimators of the nonparametric transformation, the regression coefficients and the correlation between the error terms. It is shown that the estimators of the model parameters and the transformation are consistent and asymptotically normal. We also assess the finite-sample performance of the proposed method by comparing it with an estimation method under a fully parametric model.

Right censoring can have several underlying causes: administrative censoring, loss to follow up, competing risks, etc. The (latent) censoring times corresponding to the latter two types of censoring are possibly related to the survival time of interest, and in that case this should be taken into account in the model. A unifying model is presented that allows these censoring mechanisms in one single model, and that is also able to incorporate the effect of covariates on these times. Each time variable is modeled by means of a transformed linear model, with the particularity that the error terms of the transformed times follow a multivariate normal distribution allowing for non-zero correlations. It is shown that the model is identified and the model parameters are estimated through a maximum likelihood approach. The performance of the proposed method is compared with methods that assume independent censoring using finite sample simulations. The results show that the proposed method exhibits major advantages in terms of reducing the bias of the parameter estimates. However, a strong deviation from normality and/or a strong violation of the homogeneous variance assumption may lead to biased estimates. Finally, the model and the estimation method are illustrated using the analysis of data coming from a prostate cancer clinical trial.","tags":"Source Themes","title":"A multivariate normal regression model for survival data subject to different types of dependent censoring","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
